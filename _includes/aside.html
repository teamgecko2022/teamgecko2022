              <h2>Making materials into technology is how we progress to the future.</h2>
              <p>Flexible materials that respond to stimuli have a diverse range of applications, from disaster relief to biomedicine.
                Magnetic fields in particular as a mechanism for actuation allow for human safety, which is the number 1 priority.
                Having a flexible material with more degrees of freedom and adhesive properties will have great potential in comparison to their less adaptable counterparts.
